# Dynamic Archive Connectors

This module contains the implementation of the
archive service connectors that run in the
[Archive Manager Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)](../../../engine-services/repository-governance)
hosted by the
[Engine Host OMAG Server](../../../admin-services/docs/concepts/engine-host.md).

They are responsible for building open metadata archives based on the content of the open metadata repositories.
