# Configuring the integration services

An integration service hosts one or more integration connectors.  An integration connector

Integration services run in an [integration daemon](../concepts/integration-daemon.md).

Each integration service is configured with the network location of the
[Metadata Access Point](../concepts/metadata-access-point.md) /
[Metadata Server](../concepts/metadata-server.md)
running the appropriate [Open Metadata Access Service](../../../access-services)
along with the list of connection objects for the integration connectors that will be run in the
integration service
