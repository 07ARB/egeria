# Action Scheduler Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)

The Action Scheduler OMES maintains a calendar of events and creates RequestForAction instances 
at the requested time.  For example, it may move assets between zones when a particular date is reached.
It loads **Open Scheduling Engines**,
runs **Open Scheduling Services** and
calls the [Asset Manager OMAS](../../access-services/asset-manager).
